    <p> we can use the audio element to embed audio files into a website</p>
    <audio controls src="mediapot/Recording.mp3"></audio>
    <p>the controls attribute tells the browser to supply the default play controls for the audio</p>
    <p> we can add a video to a webpage in much the same way as audio</p>
    <video controls src="mediapot/shortVid.mp4" width="500"></video>
    <p>h.264 is the most common and best video compression thing maybe AV1?</p>
    <p> we can also give videos captions as below by pointing to a text file</p>
    <video controls width="500">
        <source src="mediapot/shortVid.mp4">
        <track src="mediapot/shortVideoCaptions.en.vtt" kind="captions" label="english" srclang="en" default>
    </video>
    <p> the video element is often a poor way to add video to a website. Often better to use an embed from a video streaming
        service and take advantage of all the fancy variable bitrate compression stuff they do. See the below video from youtube</p>
